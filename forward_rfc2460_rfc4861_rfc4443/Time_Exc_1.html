<p>Verify that a router properly generates Time Exceeded Messages the Hop Limit was exceeded in transit.</p>

<pre><code>        This test verifies that CE-Router sends valid ICMPv6 Time Exceeded (code 0)
        in response to a packet which can not be forwarded.
        And this test verifies that the message processing rule,
        
        - If the message is a response to a message sent to one of the
          node&#39;s unicast addresses, the Source Address of the reply must
          be that same address.

        - If the message is a response to a message sent to an address
          that does not belong to the node, the Source Address should be
          that unicast address belonging to the node that will be most
          helpful in diagnosing the error. For example, if the message is
          a response to a packet forwarding action that cannot complete
          successfully, the Source Address should be a unicast address
          belonging to the interface on which the packet forwarding
          failed.

<h1 id="JUDGEMENT">JUDGEMENT</h1>

<pre><code>    &lt;&lt; PASS &gt;&gt;
    The CE-Router must discard the ICMPv6 Echo Request from TN2.
    Therefore, it must not forward the Echo Request.
    The CE-Router should decrement the Hop Limit to 0 and 
    send a Time Exceeded Message to TN 
    with a code field valude of 0 (Hop Limit Exceeded in transit).
         - The unused field must be initialized to zero.
         - The Source Address of the Packet should be one of the 
           CE-Router&#39;s unicast address used for packet forwarding.
         - The Destination Address should be the same as TN&#39;s Source Address.
         - The invoking Echo Request packet included in the Error Message must not exceed minimum IPv6 MTU.</code></pre>
