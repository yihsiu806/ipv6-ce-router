=item Test for Unicast address configuration

The following tests are prepared in this test package. See INDEX file.

B<Test for all node>
   When CE-Router performs DAD for its Link-local unicast address made by stateless
   address autoconfiguration, CE-Router receives DAD NA which contains same target as
   CE-Router's tentative Link-local address and contains SLL option 
   after transimitting DAD NS.

#    On receipt of a valid Neighbor Advertisement message on an interface,

# <BR>
# <BR>
# 7.1.2.  Validation of Neighbor Advertisements
# <BR>
#    A node MUST silently discard any received Neighbor Advertisement
#    messages that do not satisfy all of the following validity checks:
# <BR>
#       - The IP Hop Limit field has a value of 255, i.e., the packet
#         could not possibly have been forwarded by a router.
# <BR>
#       - If the message includes an IP Authentication Header, the message
#         authenticates correctly.
# <BR>
#       - ICMP Checksum is valid.
# <BR>
#       - ICMP Code is 0.
# <BR>
#       - ICMP length (derived from the IP length) is 24 or more octets.
# <BR>
#       - Target Address is not a multicast address.
# <BR>
#       - If the IP Destination Address is a multicast address the
#         Solicited flag is zero.
# <BR>
#       - All included options have a length that is greater than zero.
# <BR>
#    The contents of the Reserved field, and of any unrecognized options,
#    MUST be ignored.  Future, backward-compatible changes to the protocol
#    may specify the contents of the Reserved field or add new options;
#    backward-incompatible changes may  use different Code values.
# <BR>
#    <B>The contents of any defined options that are not specified to be used
#    with Neighbor Advertisement messages MUST be ignored and the packet
#    processed as normal.</B>  The only defined option that may appear is the
#    Target Link-Layer Address option.
# <BR>
#    A Neighbor Advertisements that passes the validity checks is called a
#    "valid advertisement".
