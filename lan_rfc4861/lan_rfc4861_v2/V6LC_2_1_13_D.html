<h1 id="Procedure">Procedure</h1>

<pre><code>  Part D: Multicast Neighbor Solicitation with a different SLLA
   25. TN2 transmits Packet A to the NUT.
   26. TN2 transmits Neighbor Advertisement B to the NUT after receiving any Neighbor Solicitations
        from the NUT
   27. Check the NCE of TN2 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.
   28. Wait (DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME) seconds.
   29. Check the NCE of TN2 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT..
   30. TN2 transmits Neighbor Solicitation D with a different address as the Source Link-layer Address.
   31. TN2 transmits an Echo Request to the NUT.
   32. Check the NCE of TN2 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.</code></pre>

<pre><code>  Part D

   Step 27:
   The NUT should update the NCE of TN2 to state STALE. After receiving the Echo
   Request from TN2, the NUT should send a Reply and enter state DELAY.

   Step 29:
   After DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME, the NUT should transition to state PROBE
   by sending a unicast Neighbor Solicitation to TN2.

   Step 32:
   The NUT should update TN2&#39;s Link-layer address to its new link-layer address
   from the received Neighbor Solicitation C and MUST update the state of TN2&#39;s NCE to
   STALE. The NUT should reply to the Neighbor Solicitation by sending a Neighbor
   Advertisement using TN2&#39;s new Link-Layer address. After responding to the Neighbor
   Solicitation, the NUT should respond to the Echo Request by sending an Echo Reply and set
   the state of the TN2&#39;s Entry to DELAY. After DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME, the NUT
   should send a unicast Neighbor Solicitation to TN2 using the new Link-layer address as the
   Target.</code></pre>
