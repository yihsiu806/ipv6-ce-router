<pre><code>  Part D: Multicast Neighbor Solicitation with a different SLLA
   28. TN2 transmit Echo Request A.
   29. Check the NCE of TN2 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.
   30. TN2 transmits a solicited Neighbor Advertisement B.
   31. Check the NCE of TN2 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.
   32. TN2 transmits Echo Request A.
   33. Check the NCE of TN2 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.
   34. TN2 transmits Neighbor Solicitation D with a different address as the Source Link-layer Address.
   35. TN2 transmits an Echo Request A.
   36. Check the NCE of TN2 on the NUT and observe packets transmitted by the NUT.</code></pre>

<pre><code>  Part D

   Step 29:
   The NUT should create a Neighbor Cache Entry for TN2 and set the state of the
   Entry to INCOMPLETE. The NUT should send a multicast Neighbor Solicitation to TN2.

   Step 31:
   After receiving TN2&#39;s Neighbor Advertisement, the NUT should send its queued
   Echo Reply to TN2. The NUT should then update the NCE of TN2 to state REACHABLE
   and update its link-layer address for TN2 accordingly.

   Step 33:
   Because the NUT is in state REACHABLE, after receiving the Echo Request from
   TN2, the NUT should send an Echo Reply. After DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME, the NUT
   should not send a unicast Neighbor Solicitation to TN2.

   Step 36:
   The NUT should update the NCE of TN2 to state STALE and update TN2&#39;s Link-
   layer address to its new Link-layer address from the received Neighbor Solicitation C. The
   NUT should reply to Neighbor Solicitation C by sending a Neighbor Advertisement. After
   responding to the Neighbor Solicitation, the NUT should respond to the Echo Request by
   sending an Echo Reply and set the state of the Entry to DELAY. After
   DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME, the NUT should send a unicast Neighbor Solicitation to
   TN2 with the Target set to the new Link-Layer address of TN2.</code></pre>
