=head1 NAME

  Router Sends Valid Router Advertisement 

=head1 Purpose

   Verify that a router sends valid Router Advertisements.

=head1 References

[RFC 7084],L-1, L-5, L-6
[RFC 4861],Section 6.1.2, 6.2.6

=head1 Resource Requirements

  * Packet generator
  * Monitor to capture packets

=head1 Test Setup

  Common Test Setup is performed at the beginning of this test part.

=head1 Procedure

  1. TN2 transmits a valid Router Solicitation.
  2. Observe the packets transmitted by the CE-Router.

=head1 Observable Results

  Step 2: The CE-Router must transmit valid Router Advertisements that satisfy all of
          the following validity checks:

    - IP Source Address is a link-local address.
    - The IP Hop Limit field has a value of 255, i.e., the packet could not possibly have been
       forwarded by a router.
    - If the message includes an IP Authentication Header, the message authenticates correctly.
    - ICMP Checksum is valid.
    - ICMP Code is 0.
    - ICMP length (derived from the IP length) is 16 or more octets.
    - All included options have a length that is greater than zero.

=head1 Possible Problems

  * None.
