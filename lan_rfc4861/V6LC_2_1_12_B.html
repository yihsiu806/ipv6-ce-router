<pre><code>  Part B: Unicast Neighbor Solicitation with a different SLLA
   12. TN2 transmits Echo Request A.
   13. Check the NCE of TN2 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.
   14. TN2 transmits a solicited Neighbor Advertisement B.
   15. Check the NCE of TN2 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.
   16. TN2 transmits Echo Request A.
   17. Check the NCE of TN2 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.
   18. Wait (REACHABLE_TIME * MAX_RANDOM_FACTOR) seconds.
   19. Check the NCE of TN2 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.
   20. TN2 transmits Neighbor Solicitation C with a different address as the Source Link-layer Address.
   21. TN2 transmits an Echo Request to the NUT.
   22. Check the NCE of TN2 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.</code></pre>

<pre><code>  Part B

   Step 13:
   The NUT should create a Neighbor Cache Entry for TN2 and set the state of the
   Entry to INCOMPLETE. The NUT should send a multicast Neighbor Solicitation to TN2.

   Step 15:
   After receiving TN2&#39;s Neighbor Advertisement, the NUT should send its queued
   Echo Reply to TN2. The NUT should then update the NCE of TN2 to state REACHABLE
   and update its link-layer address for TN2 accordingly.

   Step 17:
   Because the NUT is in state REACHABLE, after receiving the Echo Request from
   TN2, the NUT should send an Echo Reply. After DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME, the NUT
   should not send a unicast Neighbor Solicitation to TN2.

   Step 19:
   The NUT should update the NCE of TN2 to state STALE. (See Note in Section 2
   title page.)

   Step 22:
   The NUT should update TN2&#39;s Link-layer address to its new link-layer address
   from the received Neighbor Solicitation C. The NUT should not update the NCE of TN2 and
   should stay in state STALE. The NUT should reply to the Neighbor Solicitation by sending
   a Neighbor Advertisement to TN2&#39;s new Link-Layer address. After responding to the
   Neighbor Solicitation, the NUT should respond to the Echo Request by sending an Echo
   Reply and set the state of the TN2&#39;s Entry to DELAY. After
   DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME, the NUT should send a unicast Neighbor Solicitation to
   TN2 using the new link-layer address as the Target.</code></pre>
