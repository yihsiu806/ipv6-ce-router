=head1 NAME

  Router Advertisement Processing, Cur Hop Limit
  Part A: Unspecified

=head1 Purpose

   Verify that a node properly processes the Cur Hop Limit field of a Router Advertisement.

=head1 References

[RFC 7084],W-3
[RFC 4861],Sections 4.2, 6.2.1 and 6.3.4

=head1 Resource Requirements

  * Packet generator
  * Monitor to capture packets

=head1 Test Setup

  Common Test Setup 1.2 is performed. The Common Test Cleanup procedure is
  performed after each part.

=head1 Procedure

  Part A: Unspecified
   1. TN1 transmits an Echo Request to the CE-Router.
   2. Observe the packets transmitted by the CE-Router.
   3. TR1 transmits a Router Advertisement with a Cur Hop Limit value of 0(Zero).
   4. TN1 transmits an Echo Request to the CE-Router.
   5. Observe the packets transmitted by the CE-Router.

=head1 Observable Results

   Part A
    Step 2:
    The CE-Router should respond to the Request from TN1. Observe the Hop Limit value in
    the Echo Reply packet the CE-Router transmits.

    Step 3:
    If the CE-Router is a router, the CE-Router should transmit a Router Advertisement with a
    curHopLimit value set to zero.

    Step 5:
    The CE-Router should respond to the Request from TN1. The Hop Limit value in the
    Echo Reply should be the same as was used in step 2.

=head1 Possible Problems

  * None.
