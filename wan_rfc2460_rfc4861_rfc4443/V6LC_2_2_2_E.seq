=head1 NAME

  Router Solicitations, Solicited Router Advertisement 
  Part E: Invalid Router Advertisement, Bad ICMP Checksum

=head1 Purpose

  Verify that a host sends valid Router Solicitations at the appropriate time.

=head1 References

[RFC 7084],W-3
[RFC 4861],Section 6.3.7

=head1 Resource Requirements

  * Packet generator
  * Monitor to capture packets

=head1 Test Setup

  No Common Test Setup is performed. The Common Test Cleanup procedure is
  performed after each part.

=head1 Procedure

  Part E: Invalid Router Advertisement, Bad ICMP Checksum
   9. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 from Part A. Router Advertisement A has an invalid ICMP checksum,
      but is otherwise valid.

=head1 Observable Results

  Parts C-F
   The CE-Router should ignore the invalid Router Advertisement and continue to transmit Router
   Solicitations. The Router Solicitations should be sent from either the link-local address of the
   CE-Router or the unspecified address. The destination address should be the All-Routers multicast
   address. The Router Solicitations may or may not include a Source Link-layer Address
   option.


=head1 Possible Problems

  * None.
