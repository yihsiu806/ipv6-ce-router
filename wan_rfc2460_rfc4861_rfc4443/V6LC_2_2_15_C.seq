=head1 Procedure

  Part C: RA with SLLA changed, NCE REACHABLE
   8. TR1 transmits Echo Request B. TR1 does not respond to any Neighbor Solicitations from the
      CE-Router.
   9. Observe the packets transmitted by the CE-Router and check the NCE of TR1 on the CE-Router.
  10. TR1 transmits Neighbor Advertisement C.
  11. Check the NCE of TR1 on the CE-Router and observe the packets transmitted by the CE-Router.
  12. TR1 transmits Router Advertisement A with a different Source Link-layer Address.
  13. TR1 transmits an Echo Request to the CE-Router.
  14. Check the NCE of TR1 on the CE-Router and observe the packets transmitted by the CE-Router.

=head1 Observable Results

  Part C
   Step 9:
   The CE-Router should create a Neighbor Cache Entry for TR1 and set the state of the
   Entry to INCOMPLETE. The CE-Router should send a multicast Neighbor Solicitation to TR1.

   Step 11:
   The CE-Router should update the state of TR1's NCE to REACHABLE and record
   TR1's Link-layer Address. Because the CE-Router is in state REACHABLE, after receiving the
   earlier Echo Request from TR1, the CE-Router should send an Echo Reply using the received
   Link-Layer Address. After DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME, the CE-Router should not send a
   unicast Neighbor Solicitation to TR1.

   Step 14:
   The CE-Router must change the state of the TR1's NCE to STALE and update its Link-
   layer Address according to the Router Advertisement received in Step 12. Because the
   CE-Router's NCE for TR1 is in state STALE, the CE-Router should send an Echo Reply to TR1 using
   the new Link-Layer address and enter state DELAY. After DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME,
   the CE-Router should send a unicast Neighbor Solicitation to TR1.

=head1 Possible Problems

  * None.
