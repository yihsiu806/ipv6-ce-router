=head1 TEST PROCEDURE

Verify that a node properly procesesthe options in a single hheader in the order of occurrence.

    TN                         CE-Router
    |                           |
    |-------------------------->|
    |   Echo Request            |
    |                           |
    |                           |
    |<--------------------------|
    |   ICMP Error              |
    |                           |
    v                           v

  1. TN transmits an Echo Request that has a Destination options header with four unknown Options.
     The Optins Types are 7, 199, 71, and 135.
  2. Observe the packets transmitted by the CE-Router.

  Echo Request Data is:

        IPv6 Header
            Version            = 6
            Traffic Class      = 0
            FlowLabel          = 0
            PayloadLength      = 48
            NextHeader         = 0 (Hop-by-Hop Options Header)
            SourceAddress      = TN Link Local Address
            DestinationAddress = CE-Router Link Local Address

        Destination Options Header
            NextHeader         = 58 (ICMPv6)
            HeaderExtLength    = 3

            OptionType         = 0x07 (Unrecognized Option, Type 00)
            OptDataLength      = 4
            data               = {0, 0, 0, 0}

            OptionType         = 0xc7 (Unrecognized Option, Type 11)
            OptDataLength      = 6
            data               = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}

            OptionType         = 0x47 (Unrecognized Option, Type 01)
            OptDataLength      = 6
            data               = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}

            OptionType         = 0x87 (Unrecognized Option, Type 10)
            OptDataLength      = 6
            data               = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}

        ICMP Echo Request
            Type           = 128 (Echo Request)
            Code           = 0
            Checksum       = (auto)
            Identifier     = 0xffff
            SequenceNumber = 1
            PayloadData    = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

=head1 JUDGEMENT

  PASS: The CE-Router must send an ICMPv6 Parameter Problem message to TN.
        THe Code field must be 2(unrecognized IPv6 Option encountered).
        The Pointer field must be 0x30(offset of the Option Type field of the second option).
        The CE-Router must discard the Echo Request sent by TN and must not send a Reply.

        IPv6 Header
            Version             = 6
            Traffic Class       = 0
            FlowLabel           = 0
            PayloadLength       = 96
            NextHeader          = 58 (ICMPv6)
            SourceAddress       = CE-Router Link Local Address
            Destination Address = TN Link Local Address

        ICMP Error
            Type           = 4 (Parameter Problem)
            Code           = 2 (unrecognized IPv6 option encountered)
            Checksum       = (auto)
            Pointer        = 48 (Offset to Option Type field of 2nd option)
            PayloadData    = (Sent Packet)

# =head1 REFERENCE
# 
# RFC2460
# 
# 4.2  Options
# 
#    Two of the currently-defined extension headers -- the Hop-by-Hop
#    Options header and the Destination Options header -- carry a variable
#    number of type-length-value (TLV) encoded "options", of the following
#    format:
# 
#       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
#       |  Option Type  |  Opt Data Len |  Option Data
#       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
# 
#       Option Type          8-bit identifier of the type of option.
# 
#       Opt Data Len         8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Option
#                            Data field of this option, in octets.
# 
#       Option Data          Variable-length field.  Option-Type-specific
#                            data.
# 
# =begin html
# <PRE>
#    <B>The sequence of options within a header must be processed strictly in
#    the order they appear in the header; a receiver must not, for
#    example, scan through the header looking for a particular kind of
#    option and process that option prior to processing all preceding
#    ones.</B>
# </PRE>
# 
# =end html
# 
#    The Option Type identifiers are internally encoded such that their
#    highest-order two bits specify the action that must be taken if the
#    processing IPv6 node does not recognize the Option Type:
# 
#       00 - skip over this option and continue processing the header.
# 
#       01 - discard the packet.
# 
#       10 - discard the packet and, regardless of whether or not the
#            packet's Destination Address was a multicast address, send an
#            ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's
#            Source Address, pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.
# 
# =begin html
# <PRE>
#       <B>11 - discard the packet and, only if the packet's Destination
#            Address was not a multicast address, send an ICMP Parameter
#            Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's Source Address,
#            pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.</B>
# </PRE>
# 
# =end html
# 
#    The third-highest-order bit of the Option Type specifies whether or
#    not the Option Data of that option can change en-route to the
#    packet's final destination.  When an Authentication header is present
#    in the packet, for any option whose data may change en-route, its
#    entire Option Data field must be treated as zero-valued octets when
#    computing or verifying the packet's authenticating value.
# 
#       0 - Option Data does not change en-route
# 
#       1 - Option Data may change en-route
# 
#    The three high-order bits described above are to be treated as part
#    of the Option Type, not independent of the Option Type.  That is, a
#    particular option is identified by a full 8-bit Option Type, not just
#    the low-order 5 bits of an Option Type.
# 
#    The same Option Type numbering space is used for both the Hop-by-Hop
#    Options header and the Destination Options header.  However, the
#    specification of a particular option may restrict its use to only one
#    of those two headers.
# 
#    Individual options may have specific alignment requirements, to
#    ensure that multi-octet values within Option Data fields fall on
#    natural boundaries.  The alignment requirement of an option is
#    specified using the notation xn+y, meaning the Option Type must
#    appear at an integer multiple of x octets from the start of the
#    header, plus y octets.  For example:
# 
#       2n    means any 2-octet offset from the start of the header.
#       8n+2  means any 8-octet offset from the start of the header,
#             plus 2 octets.
