  1. TN transmits 1st Fragments with a source address of TN&#39;s Link-local address 
     and a destination address set to the CE-Router&#39;s Link-local address.
  2. Observe the packets transmitted by the CE-Router.

  Echo Request Data (original) is:

<pre><code>  PASS: The CE-Router must not transmit an Echo Reply to TN, as the Echo Request was not completed.
        The CE-Router should transmit an ICMPv6 Time Exceeded Message to TN 
        sixty seconds after reception of 1st Fragment 
        with a code field value of 1(Fragment Reassembly Time Exceeded).

             - The unused field must be initialized to zero.
             - The Source Address of the Packet must be the same as the Global 
               Destination Address of TN&#39;s Echo Request packet.
             - The Destination Address should be the same as the Global 
               Source Address of TN&#39;s Echo Request packet.
             - The invoking Echo Request packet included in the Error 
               Message must not exceed minimum IPv6 MTU.
