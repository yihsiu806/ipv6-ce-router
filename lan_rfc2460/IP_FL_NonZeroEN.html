  1. TN transmits an Send Echo Request with a Flow Label of 0x34567 to the CE-Router.
  2. Observe the packets transmitted by the CE-Router.

  Echo Request Data is:

        IPv6 Header
            Version            = 6
            Traffic Class      = 0

            PayloadLength      = 16
            NextHeader         = 58 (ICMPv6)
            SourceAddress      = TN Link Local Address
            DestinationAddress = CE-Router Link Local Address

        ICMP Echo Request

<pre><code>  The CE-Router must generate an Echo Reply.
  If the CE-Router supports use of the Flow Label field, 
  the Flow Label in the Echo Reply may be non-zero.
  Otherwise, the Flow Label field must be zero.
