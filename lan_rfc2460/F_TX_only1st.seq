  1. TN transmits 1st Fragments.
  2. Observe the packets transmitted by the CE-Router.

  Echo Request Data (original) is:

        IPv6 Header
            Version            = 6
            Traffic Class      = 0
            FlowLabel          = 0
            PayloadLength      = 88
            NextHeader         = 58 (ICMPv6)
            SourceAddress      = TN Global Address
            DestinationAddress = CE-Router Global Address

        ICMP Echo Request
            Type           = 128 (Echo Request)
            Code           = 0
            Checksum       = (auto)
            Identifier     = (auto)
            SequenceNumber = 0

                             data repeat{0x2, 40}

  Echo Request Data (1st fragment) is:

        IPv6 Header
            Version            = 6
            Traffic Class      = 0
            FlowLabel          = 0
            PayloadLength      = 40
            NextHeader         = 44 (Fragment Header)
            SourceAddress      = TN Global Address
            DestinationAddress = CE-Router Global Address

        Fragment Header
            NextHeader         = 58 (ICMPv6)
            FragmentOffset     = 0
            MFlag              = 1
            Identification     = 32bit (Automatic generation)

        Payload
            data               = 32 octets from the head of ICMP Echo request

=head1 JUDGEMENT

  PASS: The CE-Router must not transmit an Echo Reply to TN, as the Echo Request was not completed.
        The CE-Router should transmit an ICMPv6 Time Exceeded Message to TN 
        sixty seconds after reception of 1st Fragment 
        with a code field value of 1(Fragment Reassembly Time Exceeded).

             - The unused field must be initialized to zero.
             - The Source Address of the Packet must be the same as the Global 
               Destination Address of TN's Echo Request packet.
             - The Destination Address should be the same as the Global 
               Source Address of TN's Echo Request packet.
             - The invoking Echo Request packet included in the Error 
               Message must not exceed minimum IPv6 MTU.

        IPv6 Header
            Version             = 6
            Traffic Class       = 0
            FlowLabel           = 0
            PayloadLength       = 88
            NextHeader          = 58 (ICMPv6)
            SourceAddress       = CE-Router Global Address
            Destination Address = TN Global Address

        ICMP Echo Reply
            Type           = 3 (Time Exceeded)
            Code           = 1 (Fragment reassembly time exceeded)
            Checksum       = (auto)
            Reserved       = 0
            PayloadData    = (Sent Packet (1st))

# =head1 REFERENCE
# 
# RFC2460
# 
# 4.5  Fragment Header
# 
#    The following error conditions may arise when reassembling fragmented
#    packets:
# 
# =begin html
# <PRE>
#       <B>If insufficient fragments are received to complete reassembly of a
#       packet within 60 seconds of the reception of the first-arriving
#       fragment of that packet, reassembly of that packet must be
#       abandoned and all the fragments that have been received for that
#       packet must be discarded.  If the first fragment (i.e., the one
#       with a Fragment Offset of zero) has been received, an ICMP Time
#       Exceeded -- Fragment Reassembly Time Exceeded message should be
#       sent to the source of that fragment.</B>
# </PRE>
# 
# =end html
# 
#       If the length of a fragment, as derived from the fragment packet's
#       Payload Length field, is not a multiple of 8 octets and the M flag
#       of that fragment is 1, then that fragment must be discarded and an
#       ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message should be sent to the
#       source of the fragment, pointing to the Payload Length field of
#       the fragment packet.
# 
#       If the length and offset of a fragment are such that the Payload
#       Length of the packet reassembled from that fragment would exceed
#       65,535 octets, then that fragment must be discarded and an ICMP
#       Parameter Problem, Code 0, message should be sent to the source of
#       the fragment, pointing to the Fragment Offset field of the
#       fragment packet.
# 
#    The following conditions are not expected to occur, but are not
#    considered errors if they do:
# 
#       The number and content of the headers preceding the Fragment
#       header of different fragments of the same original packet may
#       differ.  Whatever headers are present, preceding the Fragment
#       header in each fragment packet, are processed when the packets
#       arrive, prior to queueing the fragments for reassembly.  Only
#       those headers in the Offset zero fragment packet are retained in
#       the reassembled packet.
# 
#       The Next Header values in the Fragment headers of different
#       fragments of the same original packet may differ.  Only the value
#       from the Offset zero fragment packet is used for reassembly.
