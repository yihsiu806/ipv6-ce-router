# =head1 REFERENCE
# 
# RFC2460
# 
# 4.5  Fragment Header
# 
#    The Fragment header is used by an IPv6 source to send a packet larger
#    than would fit in the path MTU to its destination.  (Note: unlike
#    IPv4, fragmentation in IPv6 is performed only by source nodes, not by
#    routers along a packet's delivery path -- see section 5.)  The
#    Fragment header is identified by a Next Header value of 44 in the
#    immediately preceding header, and has the following format:
# 
#    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
#    |  Next Header  |   Reserved    |      Fragment Offset    |Res|M|
#    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
#    |                         Identification                        |
#    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
# 
#    Next Header          8-bit selector.  Identifies the initial header
#                         type of the Fragmentable Part of the original
#                         packet (defined below).  Uses the same values as
#                         the IPv4 Protocol field [RFC-1700 et seq.].
# 
#    Reserved             8-bit reserved field.  Initialized to zero for
#                         transmission; ignored on reception.
# 
#    Fragment Offset      13-bit unsigned integer.  The offset, in 8-octet
#                         units, of the data following this header,
#                         relative to the start of the Fragmentable Part
#                         of the original packet.
# 
#    Res                  2-bit reserved field.  Initialized to zero for
#                         transmission; ignored on reception.
# 
#    M flag               1 = more fragments; 0 = last fragment.
# 
#    Identification       32 bits.  See description below.
# 
#    In order to send a packet that is too large to fit in the MTU of the
#    path to its destination, a source node may divide the packet into
#    fragments and send each fragment as a separate packet, to be
#    reassembled at the receiver.
# 
#    For every packet that is to be fragmented, the source node generates
#    an Identification value. The Identification must be different than
#    that of any other fragmented packet sent recently* with the same
#    Source Address and Destination Address.  If a Routing header is
#    present, the Destination Address of concern is that of the final
#    destination.
# 
#       * "recently" means within the maximum likely lifetime of a packet,
#         including transit time from source to destination and time spent
#         awaiting reassembly with other fragments of the same packet.
#         However, it is not required that a source node know the maximum
#         packet lifetime.  Rather, it is assumed that the requirement can
#         be met by maintaining the Identification value as a simple, 32-
#         bit, "wrap-around" counter, incremented each time a packet must
#         be fragmented.  It is an implementation choice whether to
#         maintain a single counter for the node or multiple counters,
#         e.g., one for each of the node's possible source addresses, or
#         one for each active (source address, destination address)
#         combination.
# 
#    The initial, large, unfragmented packet is referred to as the
#    "original packet", and it is considered to consist of two parts, as
#    illustrated:
# 
#    original packet:
# 
#    +------------------+----------------------//-----------------------+
#    |  Unfragmentable  |                 Fragmentable                  |
#    |       Part       |                     Part                      |
#    +------------------+----------------------//-----------------------+
# 
#       The Unfragmentable Part consists of the IPv6 header plus any
#       extension headers that must be processed by nodes en route to the
#       destination, that is, all headers up to and including the Routing
#       header if present, else the Hop-by-Hop Options header if present,
#       else no extension headers.
# 
#       The Fragmentable Part consists of the rest of the packet, that is,
#       any extension headers that need be processed only by the final
#       destination node(s), plus the upper-layer header and data.
# 
#    The Fragmentable Part of the original packet is divided into
#    fragments, each, except possibly the last ("rightmost") one, being an
#    integer multiple of 8 octets long.  The fragments are transmitted in
#    separate "fragment packets" as illustrated:
# 
#    original packet:
# 
#    +------------------+--------------+--------------+--//--+----------+
#    |  Unfragmentable  |    first     |    second    |      |   last   |
#    |       Part       |   fragment   |   fragment   | .... | fragment |
#    +------------------+--------------+--------------+--//--+----------+
#    fragment packets:
# 
#    +------------------+--------+--------------+
#    |  Unfragmentable  |Fragment|    first     |
#    |       Part       | Header |   fragment   |
#    +------------------+--------+--------------+
# 
#    +------------------+--------+--------------+
#    |  Unfragmentable  |Fragment|    second    |
#    |       Part       | Header |   fragment   |
#    +------------------+--------+--------------+
#                          o
#                          o
#                          o
#    +------------------+--------+----------+
#    |  Unfragmentable  |Fragment|   last   |
#    |       Part       | Header | fragment |
#    +------------------+--------+----------+
# 
#    Each fragment packet is composed of:
# 
#       (1) The Unfragmentable Part of the original packet, with the
#           Payload Length of the original IPv6 header changed to contain
#           the length of this fragment packet only (excluding the length
#           of the IPv6 header itself), and the Next Header field of the
#           last header of the Unfragmentable Part changed to 44.
# 
#       (2) A Fragment header containing:
# 
#                The Next Header value that identifies the first header of
#                the Fragmentable Part of the original packet.
# 
#                A Fragment Offset containing the offset of the fragment,
#                in 8-octet units, relative to the start of the
#                Fragmentable Part of the original packet.  The Fragment
#                Offset of the first ("leftmost") fragment is 0.
# 
#                An M flag value of 0 if the fragment is the last
#                ("rightmost") one, else an M flag value of 1.
# 
#                The Identification value generated for the original
#                packet.
# 
#       (3) The fragment itself.
# 
#    The lengths of the fragments must be chosen such that the resulting
#    fragment packets fit within the MTU of the path to the packets'
#    destination(s).
# 
#    At the destination, fragment packets are reassembled into their
#    original, unfragmented form, as illustrated:
# 
#    reassembled original packet:
# 
#    +------------------+----------------------//------------------------+
#    |  Unfragmentable  |                 Fragmentable                   |
#    |       Part       |                     Part                       |
#    +------------------+----------------------//------------------------+
# 
#    The following rules govern reassembly:
# 
#       An original packet is reassembled only from fragment packets that
#       have the same Source Address, Destination Address, and Fragment
#       Identification.
# 
#       The Unfragmentable Part of the reassembled packet consists of all
#       headers up to, but not including, the Fragment header of the first
#       fragment packet (that is, the packet whose Fragment Offset is
#       zero), with the following two changes:
# 
#          The Next Header field of the last header of the Unfragmentable
#          Part is obtained from the Next Header field of the first
#          fragment's Fragment header.
# 
#          The Payload Length of the reassembled packet is computed from
#          the length of the Unfragmentable Part and the length and offset
#          of the last fragment.  For example, a formula for computing the
#          Payload Length of the reassembled original packet is:
# 
#            PL.orig = PL.first - FL.first - 8 + (8 * FO.last) + FL.last
# 
#            where
#            PL.orig  = Payload Length field of reassembled packet.
#            PL.first = Payload Length field of first fragment packet.
#            FL.first = length of fragment following Fragment header of
#                       first fragment packet.
#            FO.last  = Fragment Offset field of Fragment header of
#                       last fragment packet.
#            FL.last  = length of fragment following Fragment header of
#                       last fragment packet.
# 
#       The Fragmentable Part of the reassembled packet is constructed
#       from the fragments following the Fragment headers in each of the
#       fragment packets.  The length of each fragment is computed by
#       subtracting from the packet's Payload Length the length of the
#       headers between the IPv6 header and fragment itself; its relative
#       position in Fragmentable Part is computed from its Fragment Offset
#       value.
# 
#       The Fragment header is not present in the final, reassembled
#       packet.
# 
#    The following error conditions may arise when reassembling fragmented
#    packets:
# 
#       If insufficient fragments are received to complete reassembly of a
#       packet within 60 seconds of the reception of the first-arriving
#       fragment of that packet, reassembly of that packet must be
#       abandoned and all the fragments that have been received for that
#       packet must be discarded.  If the first fragment (i.e., the one
#       with a Fragment Offset of zero) has been received, an ICMP Time
#       Exceeded -- Fragment Reassembly Time Exceeded message should be
#       sent to the source of that fragment.
# 
#       If the length of a fragment, as derived from the fragment packet's
#       Payload Length field, is not a multiple of 8 octets and the M flag
#       of that fragment is 1, then that fragment must be discarded and an
#       ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message should be sent to the
#       source of the fragment, pointing to the Payload Length field of
#       the fragment packet.
# 
#       If the length and offset of a fragment are such that the Payload
#       Length of the packet reassembled from that fragment would exceed
#       65,535 octets, then that fragment must be discarded and an ICMP
#       Parameter Problem, Code 0, message should be sent to the source of
#       the fragment, pointing to the Fragment Offset field of the
#       fragment packet.
# 
#    The following conditions are not expected to occur, but are not
#    considered errors if they do:
# 
#       The number and content of the headers preceding the Fragment
#       header of different fragments of the same original packet may
#       differ.  Whatever headers are present, preceding the Fragment
#       header in each fragment packet, are processed when the packets
#       arrive, prior to queueing the fragments for reassembly.  Only
#       those headers in the Offset zero fragment packet are retained in
#       the reassembled packet.
# 
#       The Next Header values in the Fragment headers of different
#       fragments of the same original packet may differ.  Only the value
#       from the Offset zero fragment packet is used for reassembly.
