=head1 TEST PROCEDURE

Verify that a node properly processes both known and unknown options, and acts in accordance with highest order two bits of the option.

   TN                          CE-Router
    |                           |
    |-------------------------->|
    |   Echo Request            |
    |                           |
    |                           |

    v                           v

  1. TN transmits an Echo Request that has a Hop-by-Hop Options header with a 6 byte PadN Options.
  2. Observe the packets transmitted by the CE-Router.

  Echo Request Data is:

        IPv6 Header
            Version            = 6
            Traffic Class      = 0
            FlowLabel          = 0
            PayloadLength      = 16
            NextHeader         = 0 (Hop-by-Hop Options Header)
            SourceAddress      = TN Link Local Address
            DestinationAddress = CE-Router Link Local Address

        Hop-by-Hop Options Header
            NextHeader         = 58 (ICMPv6)
            HeaderExtLength    = 0
            OptionType         = 1 (PadN)
            OptDataLength      = 4
            pad                = {0, 0, 0, 0}

        ICMP Echo Request
            Type           = 128 (Echo Request)
            Code           = 0
            Checksum       = (auto)
            Identifier     = 0xffff
            SequenceNumber = 1
            PayloadData    = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}


=head1 JUDGEMENT

  PASS: The CE-Router must send an Echo Reply to TN.

        IPv6 Header
            Version             = 6
            Traffic Class       = 0
            FlowLabel           = 0
            PayloadLength       = 16
            NextHeader          = 58 (ICMPv6)
            SourceAddress       = CE-Router Link Local Address
            Destination Address = TN Link Local Address

        ICMP Echo Reply
            Type           = 129 (Echo Reply)
            Code           = 0
            Checksum       = (auto)
            Identifier     = 0xffff (same as Echo Request)
            SequenceNumber = 1 (same as Echo Request)
            PayloadData    = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} (same as Echo Request)

# RFC2460
# 
# 4.2  Options
# 
#    Two of the currently-defined extension headers -- the Hop-by-Hop
#    Options header and the Destination Options header -- carry a variable
#    number of type-length-value (TLV) encoded "options", of the following
#    format:
# 
#       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
#       |  Option Type  |  Opt Data Len |  Option Data
#       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
# 
#       Option Type          8-bit identifier of the type of option.
# 
#       Opt Data Len         8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Option
#                            Data field of this option, in octets.
# 
#       Option Data          Variable-length field.  Option-Type-specific
#                            data.
# 
#    The sequence of options within a header must be processed strictly in
#    the order they appear in the header; a receiver must not, for
#    example, scan through the header looking for a particular kind of
#    option and process that option prior to processing all preceding
#    ones.
# 
#    The Option Type identifiers are internally encoded such that their
#    highest-order two bits specify the action that must be taken if the
#    processing IPv6 node does not recognize the Option Type:
# 
# =begin html
# <PRE>
#       <B>00 - skip over this option and continue processing the header.</B>
# </PRE>
# 
# =end html
# 
#       01 - discard the packet.
# 
#       10 - discard the packet and, regardless of whether or not the
#            packet's Destination Address was a multicast address, send an
#            ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's
#            Source Address, pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.
# 
#       11 - discard the packet and, only if the packet's Destination
#            Address was not a multicast address, send an ICMP Parameter
#            Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's Source Address,
#            pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.
# 
#    The third-highest-order bit of the Option Type specifies whether or
#    not the Option Data of that option can change en-route to the
#    packet's final destination.  When an Authentication header is present
#    in the packet, for any option whose data may change en-route, its
#    entire Option Data field must be treated as zero-valued octets when
#    computing or verifying the packet's authenticating value.
# 
#       0 - Option Data does not change en-route
# 
#       1 - Option Data may change en-route
# 
#    The three high-order bits described above are to be treated as part
#    of the Option Type, not independent of the Option Type.  That is, a
#    particular option is identified by a full 8-bit Option Type, not just
#    the low-order 5 bits of an Option Type.
# 
#    The same Option Type numbering space is used for both the Hop-by-Hop
#    Options header and the Destination Options header.  However, the
#    specification of a particular option may restrict its use to only one
#    of those two headers.
# 
#    Individual options may have specific alignment requirements, to
#    ensure that multi-octet values within Option Data fields fall on
#    natural boundaries.  The alignment requirement of an option is
#    specified using the notation xn+y, meaning the Option Type must
#    appear at an integer multiple of x octets from the start of the
#    header, plus y octets.  For example:
# 
#       2n    means any 2-octet offset from the start of the header.
#       8n+2  means any 8-octet offset from the start of the header,
#             plus 2 octets.
# 
# =begin html
# <PRE>
#    There are two padding options which are used when necessary to align
#    subsequent options and to pad out the containing header to a multiple
#    of 8 octets in length.  <B>These padding options must be recognized by
#    all IPv6 implementations:</B>
# </PRE>
# 
# =end html
# 
#    Pad1 option  (alignment requirement: none)
# 
#       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
#       |       0       |
#       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
# 
#       NOTE! the format of the Pad1 option is a special case -- it does
#             not have length and value fields.
# 
#       The Pad1 option is used to insert one octet of padding into the
#       Options area of a header.  If more than one octet of padding is
#       required, the PadN option, described next, should be used, rather
#       than multiple Pad1 options.
# 
# =begin html
# <PRE>
#    <B>PadN option  (alignment requirement: none)
# <BR>
#       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
#       |       1       |  Opt Data Len |  Option Data
#       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
# <BR>
#       The PadN option is used to insert two or more octets of padding
#       into the Options area of a header.  For N octets of padding, the
#       Opt Data Len field contains the value N-2, and the Option Data
#       consists of N-2 zero-valued octets.</B>
# </PRE>
# 
# =end html
# 
# 4.3  Hop-by-Hop Options Header
# 
#    The Hop-by-Hop Options header is used to carry optional information
#    that must be examined by every node along a packet's delivery path.
#    The Hop-by-Hop Options header is identified by a Next Header value of
#    0 in the IPv6 header, and has the following format:
# 
#     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
#     |  Next Header  |  Hdr Ext Len  |                               |
#     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               +
#     |                                                               |
#     .                                                               .
#     .                            Options                            .
#     .                                                               .
#     |                                                               |
#     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
# 
#    Next Header          8-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header
#                         immediately following the Hop-by-Hop Options
#                         header.  Uses the same values as the IPv4
#                         Protocol field [RFC-1700 et seq.].
# 
#    Hdr Ext Len          8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Hop-by-
#                         Hop Options header in 8-octet units, not
#                         including the first 8 octets.
# 
#    Options              Variable-length field, of length such that the
#                         complete Hop-by-Hop Options header is an integer
#                         multiple of 8 octets long.  Contains one or more
#                         TLV-encoded options, as described in section
#                         4.2.
# 
# =begin html
