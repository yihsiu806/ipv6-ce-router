  1. TN transmits an Echo Request to the CE-Router. TN answers any NS with a NA.
  2. Observe the packets transmitted by the CE-Router.
 
  3. TN transmits 1st, 2nd and 3rd Fragments in order. 
     All fragments have the same Source Address, Destination Address, and Fragment ID,
     however, the payloads of each fragment are modified so that the reassembled packet size is 1500.
  4. Observe the packets transmitted by the CE-Router.

  Echo Request Data (original) is:

        IPv6 Header
