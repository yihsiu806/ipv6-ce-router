Project Overview
================

    TAHI Project is the joint effort formed with the objective of
    developing and providing the verification technology for IPv6.

    The growth process of IPv4 was the history of encountering various kinds of
    obstacles and conquering such obstacles. However, once the position as
    infrastructure was established,
    it is not allowed to repeat the same history.
    This is a reason why the verification technology is essential for IPv6
    deployment.

        We research and develop conformance tests and interoperability tests
        for IPv6.

        We closely work with the KAME project and USAGI project.
        We help activities of these projects in the quality side by offering
        the verification technology we develop in TAHI project and improve
        the development efficiency.

        We open the results and fruits of the project to the public for FREE.
        Any developer concerned with IPv6 can utilize the results and fruits
        of TAHI project freely. A free software plays an important role
        in progress of the Internet. We believe that providing the
        verification technology for FREE contributes to advances of IPv6.
        Besides the programs, the specifications and criteria of verification
        will be included in the Package.


Organizations
=============

    TAHI Project started at October 1, 1998,
    then the project was formed by following three organizations
    (in alphabetical order):

        The University of Tokyo
        YDC Corp.
        Yokogawa Electric Corp.

    Now the project is formed by following two organizations.

        The University of Tokyo
        Yokogawa Electric Corp.


Introduction of the Package
===========================

    "CPE_Self_Test_P2" is the IPv6 Conformance Test Program Package
    written by TAHI project.
    These IPv6 conformance tests are developped to ensure requirements of
    IPv6 Ready Logo Program Phase-2 CE-Router.

    The tests run on the IPv6 Conformance Test Tool Package "v6eval",
    that is also written by TAHI project. See 00README.v6eval for more
    information about the Tool.

    Both packages "CE-Router_Self_Test_1_0_1" and "v6eval" can be obtained
    from our site:
        http://www.tahi.org/
